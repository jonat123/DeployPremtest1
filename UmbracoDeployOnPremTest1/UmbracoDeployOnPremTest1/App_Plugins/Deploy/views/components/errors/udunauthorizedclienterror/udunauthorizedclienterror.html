<div class="ud-unauthorizedclient-error">
    <h4 class="bold color-red">Authorization error</h4>
    <p>Authorization between your environments has failed.</p>
    <p>
        This could be caused by having different deploy API keys configured for each of your environments.
        API keys are specified by the "Umbraco.Deploy.ApiKey" application setting in web.config.
        Please ensure that these settings match before trying to continue.
